# BRFSS - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey

The world of Big Data is not relatively new, but has been taken notice of, in the last decade with existing and primitive data architecture infrastructures and algorithms starting to feel dated and old, with relatively slower processing and storage capabilities and an even higher influx of Data rolling in with companies to monitor and transform over reduced workload functions. 
With that in mind, we have evaluated a specific dataset from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. 
This particular Behavioral Dataset can be termed relatively “BIG”, with 58,131 observations and 62 variables. 
The evaluative capabilities with this dataset mostly pertain to evaluating several risk factors and dependencies like Smoking, drinking habits, Race, gender, education level and the likes on the General Health of an individual. 
When studying dependent outcome of these factor variables on the General health of an individual, the analysis is highly volatile and risk prone in terms of accuracy, and so, what we’ve done is to try and manage correlation patterns and similarity trends with different external factorial variables to see which ones most effect the general health and sleep patterns of an individual.
